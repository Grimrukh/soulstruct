    (or by default, all are enabled).

    The event layer is simply a 32-bit bit field (represented here as a list of enabled bit flags in little-endian
    order). The bit field is packed as a 32-bit uint surrounded by a few constants.

    When packed, the instruction will contain an offset into a packed table of event layer values, which can be shared

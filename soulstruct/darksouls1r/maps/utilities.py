            FFX, FLVER, and/or TPF files to import (e.g. for VFX events in the MSB). The source files can be FFXBND
            files to look inside, or just raw unpacked FFX files (in which case, anything after their ID in the filename
            will be removed for FFX/FLVER files). For TPF files with name suffixes like "_n", the given `file_id` may
            be a string.
        extra_character_ffx_directory: optional path to a directory containing loose FFX/FLVER/TPF files in character
            model subdirectories, to be used for models not on the known path.
        check_area_ffxbnd (bool): if True (default), and if `ffxbnd_path` is a block FFXBND file (with 'mAA_BB' in its
            file stem), the corresponding area FFXBND file ('mAA.ffxbnd') will also be checked if it exists. Any FFX
            already existing in that file will count just like existing FFX in the given block file.
        prefer_bak (bool): if True (default), look for '.bak' source files first, in case the FFXBNDs have been modded

    """Move (copy) a map piece from one map to another. Handles all FLVER (model) and TPF (texture) files - everything
    that is required to simply add the new model entry to the MSB and create MSB parts with it.

    You will still need to add the new map piece to the destination's MSB to have it appear.

    DOCUMENTATION:
        - Map piece FLVERs are named as: mXXXXBYAZZ, where XXXX is the model ID, ZZ is the area, and Y is the one-digit
        block. So map piece model 2000 in Firelink Shrine (m10_02) is `m2000B2A10.flver.dcx`.
        - If a model file is not found for any reason, that map piece will simply not appear (as with other MSB parts).
        - The BY and AZZ parts of the model file name are required. Presumably, these are automatically appended to the
        model name given in the MSB model section, so that files with the same model ID from different maps can't be
        confused.
        - Changing the model NAME in the MSB appears to do nothing. It's the SIB path that needs to be correct! The map
        piece loads if and only if the SIB is correct.
        - I'm guessing my previous finding that "existing map piece names couldn't be changed" was because I didn't
        change the SIB path (when I moved `m2000B1` to `m2009B1` in Parish to make room for `m2000B1` from Tomb). So
        that's good to know.
        - The SIB path name is `mXXXXBY.sib`, with no `AZZ` part. That suggests that only the `AZZ` part is being tacked
        on automatically. It's more complicated than that, though.
        - Changing the `mXXXX` part of the SIB path, and changing the FLVER name accordingly, works fine, as I already
        knew - but ONLY if the ID is FOUR OR LESS digits. It does not work if the ID has 5+ digits (well, I've tested 5
        and 8 and am extrapolating from there). Similar, the `BY` part can be changed as long as Y is only one digit.
        - Changing the map folder in the SIB path and moving the FLVER to that folder does NOT work, even if the other
        map is loaded (e.g. tried moving `m2000B2` to `m10_01_00_00` from Firelink). Even if this somehow did work, the
        textures wouldn't be loaded in general.
        - In fact, the parent and file extension can be removed from the SIB path, so it's literally just `mXXXXBY`, and
        it works fine. The game engine must just be reading the stem from the path.
        - Furthermore, the `B` letter doesn't matter - it can be anything, even a digit.

    So, this ultimately means I have six characters to work with after the `m` prefix. That's fine - I can use the first
    two digits for the source area and block (AB) and the last four for the source ID. So `m2000B2A10` from Firelink,
    moved to another map, would become `m022000`. Piece `m1234B1A15` from Anor Londo would become `m511234`.

    This is useful when map pieces are being moved between maps, so their textures can be easily sourced from
    the dumped folder and added to the destination map. The texture bundles (`*.tpf.dcx`) are neither decompressed or
    unpacked, as this isn't needed to move them between maps. (The map piece `FLVER` files reference `*.tga` files which
    have identical stems to the `*.tpf.dcx` files.)

    This function explicitly searches for the known folders (m10, m11, m12, ...) and will not blindly unpack textures
    from any other folders that happen to be there. However, it does not assume how many BXF binders are inside each
    map area folder.

    If `map_directory` is not given, the `DSR_PATH` from Soulstruct's config will be used.

    Always prefers `bak` files if present, but does not create any.

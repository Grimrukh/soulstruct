    """Dark Souls (either version) `MapStudio` directory.

    The format of these files is exactly the same in PTD and DSR. The vanilla DSR files have a few new additions (the
    bonfire near Vamos and lots of Arena-related entries), but you can safely use the exact same MSB files in either
    version of the game if you're not concerned with these differences.

    Note that Darkroot Garden (m12_00) has two MSB files, one ending in '00' (pre-DLC map data) and one ending in
    '01' (post-DLC map data). The PC version of the game will always have the DLC, so the '00' version is completely
    unused and ignored by Soulstruct. (You can even just delete the MSB file.) Note that 'm12_00_00_00.emevd[.dcx]'
    is still used for Darkroot's event scripts, however.

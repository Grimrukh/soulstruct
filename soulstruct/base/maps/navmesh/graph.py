"""Classes for MCG and MCP files, and other navmesh-related tools.

Currently only set up for DS1R.

Detailed information about the relationship between MSB navmeshes and collisions, MCP files, and MCG files:

    - A navmesh is a simple mesh comprised of triangular faces. Each face can one or more surface type flags associated
    with it, which are enumerated in `NavmeshFlag`.

    - Enemy pathing is plotted out as a sequence of moves from face to face (to the center of each face, specifically).
    Some enemies are not permitted to have paths planned out over faces with certain flags (e.g. only some characters
    can climb ladders).

    - Navmeshes are generally (about 95% of the time) 1:1 with collisions and generally have matching model indices
    (e.g. "n0003B0" is generally congruent with collision "h0003B0"). Sometimes, one navmesh can cover multiple
    collisions, but I don't believe I've seen one collision cover multiple navmeshes in DS1.

    - Each navmesh in a map has a corresponding "room" in that map's MCP file. This MCP list of "rooms" is 1:1 with the
    navmeshes in their order inside the MSB. These rooms are simple "AABBs" (axis-aligned bounding boxes), so they
    aren't particularly veridical to the map geometry. I've confirmed that they are generated by simply taking the min
    and max of X, Y, and Z across all vertices, and subtracting/adding an addition 0.5 to that. Each room is also
    connected to a list of other rooms in the MCP. These connections line up with gate nodes in the MCG: if an MCG node
    has edges in two navmeshes, those two navmesh rooms will be connected in the MCP. However, in DS1, there are THREE
    LOCATIONS where two navmesh rooms are connected WITHOUT sharing a gate node:
        - In m10_00 (Depths), n0032B0 completely covers n0033B0 (other side of bars that look into Giant Rat room).
        - In m12_01 (Royal Wood), n0049B1 completely covers n0050B0 (a patch in first half of Royal Wood).
        - In m13_02 (Great Hollow), n0107B2 has a drop-down to n0114B2, but there are two extremely close nodes at that
          connection point connected by a tiny edge that (incorrectly, I contend) passes through a third navmesh.

    - Each map also has an MCG file containing a graph that helps AI use the navmesh. The nodes in this graph are
    "gates" between navmeshes (or equivalently, MCP rooms), with "edges" connecting them that each pass through one
    navmesh index. Each edge also has a list of triangles that lie on top of the node in each navmesh that it connects
    to. (This seems a bit silly to me; the triangles should really be stored with the node, and this is exactly what I
    do in Blender. But in the MCG file, they're repeated over all edges that use that node.) If a node connects to a
    "dead end" navmesh that contains no edges, it will also reference it, as otherwise that navmesh would not feature in
    the graph at all. (A node cannot have TWO dead-end navmeshes for obvious reasons.)

    - The MCP navmesh rooms control *backread*, based on the player's distance from that room's box (likely a simple
    raycast). The game also only seems to check the distance to rooms that are connected to the one the player is
    standing inside (or was last standing inside). This is why it is CRITICAL that your MCP files are accurate to your
    navmeshes, particularly for connections between maps (as the backread status of other maps' collisions REQUIRES this
    navmesh raycast to succeed, whereas collisions inside the same map can use display groups).

    - The "navmesh groups" of navmeshes that are in backread (because their corresponding rooms are close enough and
    connected) are used to upgrade two backread tables, one "normal" (possibly characters, objects, etc., or possibly
    unused) and one "hit" (collisions). In DS1, the distances for "normal" backread (enabled at 20m, disabled at 25m)
    are smaller than for "hit" backread (enabled after spending 0.2s closer than 80m, disabled after spending 1.3s
    further than 90m). You can play with these values in the debug menu (`GAME > WorldBackRead`).

    - By default (i.e. without any navmeshes and no navmesh-produced backread), the player's current collision has
    backread 4 (low + hi poly versions), all other collisions in the current map have backread 2 (low poly only), and
    all collisions in all other loaded maps have backread 0.

    - These backreads states are "upgraded" by navmesh backread groups. If a navmesh's MCP AABB is within the "hit"
    backread distance, it achieves a non-zero backread level (2) and is loaded (appears under "WorldBackRead" menu).
    However, only its low-poly version is loaded.

    - The distance to the room the player is currently inside is always 0.0. If the player is standing inside multiple
    rooms, the game appears to prefer the room that matches the player's navmesh, or that is inside the map of the
    player's current collision? Unclear exactly how this preferential system works, but it does seem that the game only
    checks the distance of rooms that are linked to the last room the player was inside.

    - Any collisions whose navmesh groups are covered by the navmesh group of a triggered navmesh will be "upgraded".
    Collisions in the current map will go from backread 2 to backread 4. Collisions in connected maps will go from
    backread 0 to backread 2.

    - That is, navmesh groups and an intact navmesh-produced backread system are NECESSARY to get collisions in other
    connected maps to load. The connection's display groups alone can't get backread high enough to give the other map's
    collisions any actual physics!

    - The *draw groups* of collisions appear to be used for *children only*! Actual collision physics are determined
    solely by backread state, which is determined by navmesh rooms and navmesh groups.

Notes for functional navmesh system:

    - Every navmesh must have at least one "related" node. Related nodes are nodes that have an edge passing through
    that navmesh's AABB (as referenced by `edge.connected_aabb`) or nodes that explicitly reference that AABB through
    their `node.connected_aabb` attribute. The game uses this direct connection IF AND ONLY IF the navmesh has no nodes
    that are related through edges - that is, a "dead end" navmesh that has no edges within it.

    - Every navmesh must have at least one connected AABB in its `aabb.connected_aabbs` attribute, or it will never
    enter backread, even when standing on it (and may screw up other navmeshes nearby as well).

    - Gate node positions do not affect backread, but the connectivity BETWEEN them does seem to inform which navmeshes
    can enter backread from a distance. As long as the two requirements above are met (and `ConnectCollision` instances
    are set up properly), you will probably be able to navigate the world without issues, as navmeshes enter backread
    "just in time" when walking on them, but proper connected nodes are needed for the actual raycasting 80m/90m system
    to work. This will need to be done for enemy behavior anyway.

    - It should go without saying that breaking correspondence between the connected nodes and edges of nodes will
    cause major issues, so don't do this. You can tell if the navmesh system is broken completely because that map will
    not appear as an option at the bottom of the debug `WorldNvmMan` menu.

Miscellaneous extra notes (made long after the above):

    - MCG gates are definitely used to determine map backread. If you're near a gate that has a connection to a gate
    that is near a connect collision ("near" being somehow determined by physical navmeshes), that map will enter
    backread.

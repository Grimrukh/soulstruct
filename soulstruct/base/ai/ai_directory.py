        """Unpack LuaBND scripts in a directory (usually `script`) into one single modifiable structure.

        Note that the vanilla game uses pre-compiled Lua bytecode for a minor efficiency upgrade, but uncompiled Lua
        scripts work just as well. Use the `.decompile_all()` method to generate them from any compiled scripts
        (currently does not work for PTDE or Bloodborne).
        TODO: Has Katalash upgraded this decompiler to support Bloodborne?

        The same script will work in both PTDE and DSR, but decompiling is only offered (with Katalash's
        'DSLuaDecompiler' tool) for DSR. PTDE files have the variable names stripped anyway, which makes them much
        harder to edit even when decompiled. If you want to customize PTDE scripts, I recommend doing all the work in
        DSR and then just copying the scripts over.

        `aiCommon.luabnd` ('Common') contains scripts that are loaded in all maps, which includes internal scripts
        with global functions that are accessed in every script. If you want to decompile these internal scripts, you
        must call `AIDirectory.Common.decompile(battle_or_logic_only=False)`, and similar to recompile them
        (for testing) or save the decompiled scripts into the LuaBND.

        `eventCommon.luabnd` contains scripts that are solely internal. This BND is unpacked in `.event_common_bnd`
        for manual inspection and modification, if you really want, but this shouldn't be necessary. It is written
        automatically by `.save()`.

        Note that you only need to reload the map (e.g. by saving and quitting, or getting sufficiently far away from
        the map) to see changes in these files while playing the game. You do NOT need to fully restart the game, unlike
        with text and parameter/lighting changes, *UNLESS* you need to reload a script in Common.

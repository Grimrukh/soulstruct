    TODO: Chalice Dungeons (m29) are currently not supported.

    Unlike Dark Souls, it is possible that the copy of Bloodborne you have access to could have a different patch level,
    which may affect the latest version of each MSB you have. Currently, this class only supports the latest patch 1.09,
    which means the following non-zero MSB versions are asserted:
        m23_00_00_01
        m24_00_00_01
        m24_01_00_11
        m24_02_00_01
        m27_00_00_01
        m28_00_00_01
        m32_00_00_01

    You can always rename your MSB file to this latest version until it is properly supported by Soulstruct (which may
    never happen).

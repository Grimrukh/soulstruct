                        This is a completely made-up example of an event
                        script for Dark Souls 1. In practice, you'll want
                        to decompile the vanilla scripts, then edit them,
                        or you'll lose all the events you don't want to
                        change. (If this script were actually the EMEVD
                        file for the Depths, you would experience broken
                        bonfires and doors, impenetrable fog, and one
                        very aggressive Gaping Dragon, among other large
                        issues.) See 'example.py' in the same folder for
                        a version of this script with no comments, which
                        is easier to read for actual content.

                        Check out the 'soulstruct/events/vanilla_evs_ptd'
                        folder for EVS versions of the vanilla event
                        scripts from Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition.
                        (These will work absolutely fine in Dark Souls
                        Remastered as well, though the new Vamos bonfire
                        won't work and the Battle of Stoicism PvP arena
                        will be even more useless.)

                        You can also use the 'vanilla_base_map' argument
                        of the EMEVD class to use specify one of these
                        vanilla maps to use as the 'base' versions of any
                        events you don't define in your own script, though
                        you will still need the Constructor (event 0) and
                        maybe Preconstructor (event 50) functions in most
                        cases to run any new events you write. (This
                        feature is currently for DS1 only.)

                        The differences in EMEVD from Dark Souls 1 through
                        to Sekiro are small (excluding DS2, where EMEVD is
                        completely absent). The main changes are slight
                        differences in the EMEVD instruction set, which
                        generally expanded with each game. Bloodborne also
                        introduced the "Label" and "Goto" family of
                        instructions, which is easier to use than the
                        "SkipLines" family but probably still not as easy
                        as the Python-level control flow offered in EVS.

                        You can ask me anything on the ?ServerName? Dark
                        Souls modding Discord. I'm sure there are bugs and
                        typos; I haven't tried every single instruction and
                        test yet. You can raise these on GitHub as well.

                        Check out my StJudeSouls repository for the actual
                        EVS 'source code' I used to create the St. Jude mod
                        for LobosJr. It's not especially neat, but there's
                        a lot of real EVS work there for you to look at. In
                        particular, you'll see a lot of the useful high-
                        level control flow features that don't appear in
                        the decompiled vanilla scripts.

                        All the best with your event modding, and I hope
                        EVS helps.
                                                                   Grimrukh

# This star import is purely so your intelli-sense can pick up all the instructions, tests, and other EVS wrapper
# functions. It is ignored by the compiler and can actually be removed entirely if you don't care about auto-completion
# or intelli-sense inspection, etc. Make sure you import from the right game, or your intelli-sense may lead you down
# paths that the game-specific compiler you call on this script can't follow...
from soulstruct.darksouls1r.events import *

# We'll need this import to declare our event arguments as specific game types like Character and Region, which in turn
# allows us to test certain boolean properties of those objects directly. (Again, this is just for intelli-sense - the
# compiler is fully aware of all the game types, whether you import them here or not.)
from soulstruct.game_types import *

# This import actually matters. You should define your constants in a separate Python script, and import them here.
# See 'example_constants.py' for examples. You can then use these constants in your EVS script below. The intent is
# that you can carefully control which constants (particularly Flags) each map's script has access to, which will
# reduce the chances of accidental, crippling, silent bugs caused by using the wrong one. Note that unlike the general
# star import above, any imports here do matter to the compiler and will determine what constants it has access to.
from example_constants import *


# After constant imports, the rest of the EVS script is strictly comprised of NAME ASSIGNMENTS and EVENT FUNCTION
# DECLARATIONS (one per event). I'll go over the components of a couple of simple examples you might find in the Depths.


# We've already imported a bunch of constants from 'example_constants.py', but you can also define constants in the
# global namespace of your EVS script (i.e. outside all event function declarations). You can assign to any standard
# Python statement except a function call. Let's define an extra constant now (in glorious all-caps for clarity):
DOOR_INACTIVE_DELAY = 2.0

# NOTE: There's a current 'gotcha' in EVS, where all of these global name assignments will be evaluated *before* any
# event script functions are compiled. That means that ONLY THE LAST ASSIGNMENT to any given name will be used in ALL
# of your event scripts. So you can't redefine any of these constants between event functions to change their value
# which is something I'd strongly discourage anyway, as these are supposed to be constants.


# EVENT NAME: The name of the function should be the event name. This is completely up to you and will be stripped from
# the binary EMEVD. After creating an EmevdCompiler() instance, you can look at all of your events with the `events`
# attribute, which has event names for keys. You can also call the event name as a shortcut for calling RunEvent on
# its name or ID, with arguments (if it has any).

# This event happens to be the constructor, which I've put in caps as a note to myself that I shouldn't be actually
# calling this anywhere. In future, I'll probably force you to call this CONSTRUCTOR and force its ID to be 0 so you
# know what you're doing. (There's also a PRECONSTRUCTOR with ID 50, which is called before the CONSTRUCTOR and
# handles things that are assumed to be done by the CONSTRUCTOR - notably, updating NPC story flags.)

    # This event takes arguments when run, which creates an 'instance' of the event that has specific constants.

    # arguments here, as order matters, and the first argument must always be the slot number.
    DespawnChanneler(0, CHARACTERS.DepthsChanneler)

    # The event above could probably have had the Channeler hard-coded into it, but here's an event that actually has
    # multiple instance slots created: the trigger for Slimes falling onto you from the ceiling. I've just used the IDs

    # Often, you'll want to initialize numerous event slots that may only vary a little bit. You can take care of that

    #     - You can't use nested tuples as loop variables.
    #     - You can't overwrite the names of any event arguments.
    #     - The only functions you can use when generating the sequence to iterate over are builtins 'zip' and 'range'.

    # is hard-coded inside the loop and added to the changing loop variables.

    # If you look at the actual numeric output of your script, you'll notice that these two lines are compressed into a

# use all(conditions) and any(conditions) to try to construct elaborate chain skips that can often mimic complex
# conditions (these are used often in the CONSTRUCTOR and PRECONSTRUCTOR - in fact, FROM *never* uses conditions in
# either of these events). And a bunch of other stuff, like implicitly checking if a player owns a weapon (for example)
# by writing 'if WEAPONS.BlackKnightHalberd: ...'.
